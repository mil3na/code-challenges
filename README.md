Coding Challenges Solutions
===============

Here are the solutions I propose for some problems in my favourites code challenge websites. Also, I'm rewriting my old solutions (that were written in Java and C++) using languages that I'm using in my daily basis (Python, JavaScript and, maybe, Ruby).


I'm doing this for fun and there's no guarantee that these are the correct or most efficient answers :)
